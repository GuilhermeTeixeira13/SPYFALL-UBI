## Party Game: Spy vs Investigator

The objective of this project is to implement a party game that can be played by four or more players. In this game, two types of players face off: spies and investigators. At the beginning of each round, each investigator is assigned a location (considering iconic places at UBI: canteen, Phase VI bar, amphitheater 6.01, library, etc.), while each spy is informed of their role and remains unaware of the other players' locations. Players (following the order determined by the application) ask each other yes-or-no questions about the location (e.g., "Did you enjoy your last visit there?"). Investigators use these questions to try to identify spies (through false or suspicious answers), while spies aim to discover the location (alongside the clues gathered from other questions) without revealing their ignorance to the others. At any point during the round, a player (investigator or spy!) can accuse another player of being a spy. If the majority of players agree with the accusation, the accused player must reveal their identity (investigator or spy) and is eliminated. Additionally, at any point during the round, a spy can attempt to guess the location. If they guess correctly, they are declared the winner; otherwise, they are eliminated. The game ends when all spies are discovered, the location is revealed by a spy, or only 2 players remain.

The basic version of the application should accept the names of all users, randomly determine their turn to play and the role assigned to them, randomly select a location, and start the game. The gameplay mechanics involve passing the (sanitized) mobile phone from hand to hand, revealing only the information that each player needs to know.

The enhanced version of the application should provide highly appealing descriptions for each location (especially considering people who have never been to UBI) with interesting facts, images, and other engaging elements. Consider the possibility of expanding the game to other languages as a way to broaden knowledge and appeal to a wider audience.
